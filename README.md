### I'd just like to interject for a moment. What youâ€™re referring to as Xplshn, is in fact, Coffee/Xplshn, or as Iâ€™ve recently taken to calling it, Coffee plus Xplshn. Xplshn is not a developer unto itself, but rather another _free_ component of a fully functioning productivity suite made useful by the Coffee mugs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full shut-in as defined by Societyâ„¢.
